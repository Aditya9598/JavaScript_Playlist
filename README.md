Welcome to the **JavaScript From Scratch** playlist! This repository contains all the source code and project files for the tutorial series, designed to help beginners master JavaScript by building practical projects along the way.

## Introduction to JavaScript
In this section, you'll learn:
- What JavaScript is and how it works in the browser.
- Adding JavaScript to an HTML document.
- Basic syntax, including variables, data types, and operators.

## JavaScript Basics
This part covers:
- Conditionals (if, else, switch statements).
- Loops (for, while, forEach).
- Objects and arrays.
- Basic array and string methods.

## Functions and Scope
Understanding functions:
- Declaring functions (function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions).
- Function parameters and return values.
- Scope and closures.

## DOM Manipulation
Learn how to interact with the Document Object Model:
- Selecting elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.
- Modifying HTML elements dynamically.
- Changing styles and attributes via JavaScript.

## Event Handling
Working with user interactions:
- Listening for events (clicks, keypresses, form submissions).
- Adding event listeners.
- Preventing default behavior.

## Asynchronous JavaScript
An introduction to asynchronous programming:
- Callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`.
- Fetch API to make HTTP requests.
- Error handling in asynchronous code.

## Mini Projects
This playlist includes three mini projects to solidify your JavaScript knowledge:

### Project 1: To-Do List
A dynamic to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. It utilizes DOM manipulation and event handling to build interactivity.

### Project 2: Calculator
A simple calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), using functions, event listeners, and DOM manipulation.

### Project 3: Weather App
A weather app that fetches real-time weather data from an API. It demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch` and `async/await`) to display data dynamically.
